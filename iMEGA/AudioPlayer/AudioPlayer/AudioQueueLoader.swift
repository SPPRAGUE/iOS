/// The loader takes a list of tracks and delivers them in batches for playback.
/// When the player's queue drops to or below a defined threshold, the loader fetches and inserts the next batch.
/// It supports preloading of the next batch.
///
/// **Key Features:**
/// - **Batch Loading:**
///   Returns up to `batchSize` tracks for immediate playback via `addAllTracks(_:)` and refills the queue when the queue count falls to or below `queueThreshold`.
/// - **Staged Preloading:**
///   Prepares the next batch in advance using `prepareNextBatch()`, storing it in `pendingBatch` so it can be inserted quickly without waiting for load.
/// - **Customization:**
///   - `batchSize`: Number of tracks loaded per batch (default is 100).
///   - `queueThreshold`: Queue count threshold that triggers loading a new batch (default is 50).
