/// Purpose of this class is to decouple Home screen and its Search bar view from the search results screen which is being replaced
/// by modern generic solution in the Search module
/// It implements delegate protocols that mediate communication SearchBar <-> HomeSearchResultsViewController
/// As we want to hide the new feature behind a flag, we need this intermediate layer to
/// not have to change too much in the existing implementation of search results which will go away eventually
